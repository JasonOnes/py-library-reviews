# py-library-reviews

Just a quick way to review/explore the different built-in libraries for Python 3.6 culled directly from the source (https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html).
This will also keep me current on my Python syntax and best practices.

My plan is to spend a little time on a random library whenever I've got a little free time and write a little script demonstrating my understanding of it's usage.
